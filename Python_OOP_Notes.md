#### Be careful not to have python's keywords as classnames (print, for etc)

##### A function that's part of a class is called a method

#### ```__init__()``` has two underscores on each side

#### ```self``` automatically passes the instance itself as the first argument to the method. So ```self``` is a way for you to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and methods within the class definition

#### Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance

#### An Object is an instance of a class. You can call refer to 'it' as an instance or object (poteto potato)

#### The Dog class is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual instances representing specific dogs
