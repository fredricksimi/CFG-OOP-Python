"""

1. Restaurant: 
    Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant
    should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.

    Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of 
    information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

    Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.



2. Three Restaurants: 
    Start with your class from Question 1. 
    Create three different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each instance.


3. Users:
    Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, 
    and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. 

    Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the user's information. 

    Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user


4. Number Served: 
    Start with your program from Question 1. 
    Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
    Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
    Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this 
    value and print it again.

    Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
    customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print 
    the value again.

    Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment 
    the number of customers who've been served. Call this method with any number 
    you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of 
    business.

    
5. Login Attempts: 
    Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from Question 3.

    Write a method called increment_login_attempts() that increments the value 
    of login_attempts by 1. 
    
    Write another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value 
    of login_attempts to 0.

    Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times. 
    
    Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented properly, and 
    then call reset_login_attempts().

    Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
